// is a plain `dependsOn` with nothing to remember on CI. The cost is three small text files per

  // Declaring the directory as an output of the one task the check reads models what the task
  // actually produces and fixes that. It buys a second thing too: after a full `build`, where
  // every target writes over the shared directory, this task is out of date again and re-runs, so
